# Poker Result Visualization

## Overview

This repository contains a Python script for visualizing the frequency of poker hand results across different stages of the game (flop, turn, river) using Matplotlib and Pandas.

## ðŸš€ How it works

The Python script takes a dictionary containing poker hand data as input. The data includes the player's hand, flop, turn, river, and corresponding results. It then creates bar charts using Matplotlib to display the frequency of each result category at each stage of the game.

## ðŸ“‹ Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook
- Matplotlib
- Pandas
